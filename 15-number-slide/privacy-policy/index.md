# Privacy Policy

The 15 Number Slide mobile app ("the app") uses third party tools including:

- Google Analytics
- Google AdMob

## Google Analytics

Google Analytics is used to measure and optimize user acquisition and engagement
with mobile apps. Google Analytics enables the app to:

- Understand the number of users in your app, their characteristics, and where they come from.
- Measure what actions your users are taking.
- Measure in-app payments and revenue.
- Customize reports specific to your business.
- Visualize user navigation paths.
- Slice and dice your data to understand different user groups' behavior
- Leverage Google Analytics data in other Google products.

Google Analytics ultimately enables the developer to continually improve the
experience for all users.

Google Analytics automatically collects certain data and offers optional
features that determine which additional types of data are collected and how
they are used.

- An app instance id is automatically assigned to each instance of an app, for
  purposes of computing user metrics throughout Analytics. By default, this
  identifier is not associated with a user identifier, like screen name or
  account ID, or with a device’s advertising identifier.
- Google Analytics does not use Apple’s Location Services feature. Analytics
  derives general location data from users’ anonymized IP addresses.
- In-app purchase and subscription events are measured via StoreKit. Event
  parameters include product ID, name, and price. By default, these events are
  only associated with the app instance id.
- App lifecycle events, such as screen views and sessions, are automatically
  measured and used for Analytics features like Reporting and Exploration. By
  default, these events are only associated with the app instance id.

## Google AdMob

Google AdMob is a mobile advertising platform that you can use to generate
revenue. It allows the app to show ads from Google advertisers in real time
through the AdMob platform to simplify ad operations. It includes banner, native
and video ads which create a positive user experience by matching the look and
feel of the app.

To improve the performance of AdMob, certain information may be collected, including:

- IP address, which may be used to estimate the general location of a device.
- Non-user related crash logs, which may be used to diagnose problems and
  improve the SDK. Diagnostic information may also be used for advertising and
  analytics purposes.
- User-associated performance data such as app launch time, hang rate, or energy
  usage, which may be used to evaluate user behavior, understand the
  effectiveness of existing product features, and plan new features. Performance
  data may also be used for displaying ads, including sharing with other
  entities that display ads.
- A Device ID such as the device's advertising identifier or other app-bounded
  device identifiers, which may be used for the purpose of third-party
  advertising and analytics.
- Advertising data, such as advertisements the user has seen, may be used to
  power analytics and advertising features.
- Other user product interactions like app launch taps, and interaction
  information, like video views, may be used to improve advertising performance.
