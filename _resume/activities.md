    description: "At Siena, some of the upper class Finance majors were a part of the student managed fund. This fund was real and we were managing real money. There were 5 officers who were in charge of the other students and managed their work with the fund. I was one of the officers and I was also <a href=\"https://www.siena.edu/news-events/article/adirondack-cup-an-investment-in-the-future\" target=\"_blank\">Siena's Team Leader</a> for the <a href=\"http://www.adirondackfunds.com/adirondack-cup/\" target=\"_blank\">Adirondack Cup</a>. This was a competition where we created a hypothetical portfolio of small cap stocks and tried to outperform 15 other colleges."

    description: "I was a <a href=\"https://www.siena.edu/academics/academic-services-resources/tutoring\" target=\"_blank\">tutor</a> for math classes at Siena. The classes were primarily for students in the School of Business and included math that dealt with decision making, calculus, and statistics. I tutored at weekly group sessions, where students were encouraged to come if they were struggling with the concepts introduced during lecture."

    description: "I was involved with the <a href=\"https://www.siena.edu/residence-hall-association-rha\" target=\"_blank\">Residence Hall Association</a> at Siena for three of my four years at the school. I held multiple positions including President and Vice-President of Finance. Residence Hall Association was a young club when I joined it and was a way for students to meet, mingle, and have a good time with other students from their hall. We held fundraising and social events that were designed to get everyone to come out of their rooms and get together to have some fun!"
