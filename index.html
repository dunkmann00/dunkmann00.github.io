                Welcome to my website! My name is George Waters and as the title says, I develop apps for the iOS platform. 
                Not full time though, currently it is a hobby that I do in my free time. I graduated college in 2014 and 
                have since been working at a financial advisory firm. I do find finance very interesting (it is what I majored in) 
                but I love software development and would love to make it my full time job. I have three awesome apps currently 
                on the app store that you can check out <a href="/projects">here!</a> I'm always trying to think of new app ideas I can make so if 
                you have something you want to see turned into an app <a href="/contact">let me know!</a> I'd be glad to see if it is something I 
                could help make happen.
